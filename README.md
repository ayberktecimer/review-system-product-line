# Review System Product Line

* Review System as a product line
  * Rating/Commenting functionality       
  * Branching to 3 different review systems:
    * Hotel Review
    * Restaurant Review
    * Movie Review
<em>
Note that this is a dysfunctional project. The purpose is to show feature commonalities and variabilities
of different products in a product line. Thus, the only data client receives from the server is regarding
which features do the products have. This features are determined by feature flags (config_file-***) and
some design patterns.
